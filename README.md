# Battleships

## An A Level project written using Python and PyGame to teach Coordinate Geometry

This project is intended to introduce the concepts of coordinate Geometry to school children in a fun way using
game technology.

The game is a fun easy to use desktop game for 1 or two players.

It keeps scores in order to add an element of competition and generates random cartesian coordinate system on the 
game boards, so that each game is a unique challenge to the students.

The technologies used in writing this are as follows:
- Python (Computer Language)
- Visual Studio 2017for the IDE
- Coding Standards use PEP 8 standard (https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#class-names)
- Object Orientated Programming Techniques as the programing style 
- Pygame - as the gaming library
- Photoshop for the screen designs
  - The game incorporates 
    - Graphics
    - Sound
    - Custom Fonts
