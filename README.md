# Battleships

## An A Level project written using Python and PyGame to teach Coordinate Geometry

This project is intended to introduce the concepts of coordinate Geometry to school children in a fun way using
game technology.

The game is a fun easy to use desktop game for 1 or two players.

It keeps scores in order to add an element of competition and generates random cartesian coordinate system on the 
game boards, so that each game is unique challenge to the students.

The technologies used in writing this are as follows:
- Python (Computer Language)
- Object Orientated Techniques as the programing language 
- Pygame - as the gaming library
  - Incorporates 
    - Graphics
    - Sound
    - Custom Fonts
